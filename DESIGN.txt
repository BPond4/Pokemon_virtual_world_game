Background: some or all of these could be moved to WorldModel. -- moved all to worldmodel -- done
setBackground
getBackgroundImage
get/set background cell

Entity:
getCurrentImage -- left as static, means it could maybe be moved?? -- made instance -- done
create____Action -- could be moved to action for continuity (return type) -- moved to functions() -- done

Point: (method made (private static) and left in class) -- done
adjacent -- left as static because multiple objects passed as parameters, 'this' probably wouldnt work

WorldModel: (methods made (private static) and left in class) -- done
nearestEntity -- doesn't use worldmodel data, could be moved to entity for continuity? 
distanceSquared -- same as adjacent in point, also uses points so not sure
